# FormantPath-vowels
Application of Praat's "To FormantPath..." command for getting by speaker, by token formant ceilings. Intended as an alternative to setting ceiings general based on speaker sex. Allows for many formant measurements per token which may later be grouped according to token means or medians. D

Demoed in get_formant_path.ipynb for single and paired speaker recordings. Requires [parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth), [phonlab](https://github.com/rsprouse/phonlab), and [audiolabel](https://github.com/rsprouse/audiolabel) libraries.
