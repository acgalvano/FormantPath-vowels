# FormantPath-vowels
Application of Praat's "To FormantPath..." method for getting by speaker, by token formant ceilings. Intended as an alternative to setting ceiings general based on speaker sex. Allows for many formant measurements per token which may later be grouped according to token means or medians. Demoed for single and paired speaker recordings. Requires [parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth), [phonlab](https://github.com/rsprouse/phonlab), and [audiolabel](https://github.com/rsprouse/audiolabel) libraries.
